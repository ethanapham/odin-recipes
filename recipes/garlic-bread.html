    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A fresh cheesy garlic bread can be easily made with fresh ingredients found in your local bakery and Safeway!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 loaf of Italian bread</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>2 sticks of butter</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic (will be roasted)</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic (fresh)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>3 tbsp freshly chopped parsley</li>
        <li>2 cups (or however much you want) grated mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut a whole head of garlic in half and lay them face up (bulbs should be exposed) on a long piece of tin foil.</li>
        <li>Drizzle across both heads with olive oil and then hit them with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) Throw in some fresh thyme next to the garlic.</li>
        <li>Wrap the contents up in the tin foil into a ball and put into a 300 degree oven for about 45 minutes - 1 hour.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, get a bowl and throw your two sticks of butter in there. You want it a little warm/melted, so leave it out while the garlic cooks.</li>
        <li>Once the garlic cools off, take it out of the oven, and squeeze the roasted bulbs into the softened butter.</li>
        <li>Mince your fresh garlic and throw it in as well. Also, add a little bit of freshly chopped parsley + salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Mix with your hands or a spoon until you get a nicely mixed compound butter.</li>
        <li>Cut open in half your loaf of Italian bread.</li>
        <li>Spread a nice even layer of your compound butter on each loaf, and put them into a 400 degree oven (Around 5-10 minutes)</li>
        <li>Take out the bread and cover the entire surface with the grated mozzarella (Don't leave any bread showing!)</li>
        <li>Put it back into the oven at 400 degrees for about 5-10 minutes again (or into the broiler).</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
